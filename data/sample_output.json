This is because the stock adjusted to a 1:1 bonus issue which was earlier announced by the company. After closing at Rs 5,336.50 apiece on November 25, the stock opened nearly 50 percent lower at Rs 2,682 apiece on November 26. The stock in practical terms was trading in the green with marginal gains at Rs 2,670 apiece at 10.40 am on NSE.   While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the market capitalization of the company. This increases the overall liquidity of the stock, and makes it more affordable for other investors to add to their portfolio, creating strong upside potential for the stock.     The firm's revenue from operations meanwhile rose around 16 percent YoY to Rs 1,027.40 crore during the quarter under review. It had earlier reported revenue from operations at Rs 887.21 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. Follow allLIVE updatesfrom the stock markets here.

In newly-revealed details by the Central Industrial Security Force, it has come to light that hours after India carried out Operation Sindoor on the night of May 7, Pakistan had allegedly launched a retaliatory strike on the Uri Hydro Electric Power Projects in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack, which involved shelling and drone threats, was successfully foiled by a small team of CISF personnel, ensuring there was no damage to the strategic installation, the Central Industrial Security Force said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Amid intense cross-border shelling in May 2025, CISF teams at Uri Hydro Electric Projects displayed extraordinary courage, safeguarding vital national assets and evacuating 250 civilians to safety despite the high risk to their own lives,\" it noted.  Amid intense cross-border shelling in May 2025, CISF teams at Uri Hydro Electric Projects displayed extraordinary courage, safeguarding vital national assets and evacuating 250 civilians…pic.twitter.com/NPd0KkHaVp — CISF (@CISFHQrs)November 25, 2025  Led by Commandant Ravi Yadav, the 19-member team had acted swiftly to evacuate 250 civilians, neutralise drones, reinforce bunkers, secure armory stockpiles, maintain critical communications, and carry out real-time threat analysis, ensuring the safety of the hydroelectric plant and nearby residential areas, as per the CISF. The Uri hydroelectric plant, located on the River Jhelum in Baramulla district, lies just a few kilometres from theLine of Control(LoC), making it a high-risk target. As per an official, “The Uri projects were among the first targets due to their proximity to the LoC. Thanks to strong intelligence networks and prepared on-ground troops, drones were shot down, and a massive evacuation was executed without any loss of life.” The retaliatory strike followed India’s Operation Sindoor, launched shortly after midnight on May 7 in response to the heinous April 22 Pahalgam attack, during which the Indian military targeted and destroyed nine terror camps across the LoC in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Pakistan’s retaliatory response included indiscriminate shelling and drone attacks targeting the hydroelectric facility and surrounding civilian areas.  On Tuesday, the 19 CISF personnel were awarded the Director General’s Disc at CISF headquarters in New Delhi for their “exemplary courage and steadfast commitment to the nation” in protecting critical infrastructure and civilian lives under fire.

In its statement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office alleged that, “this reflected a broader pattern of pressure on religious minorities in India and deliberate attempts at eroding Muslim cultural and religious heritage under the influence of majoritarian Hindutva ideology.” The comments come even as Pakistan itself has long been a hotspot for violence against religious minorities, including Hindus, Christians, and Ahmadiyya Muslims. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), violence and harassment against Christians and Hindus persisted across Pakistan in the first half of 2025, with authorities frequently failing to ensure accountability. In June, for instance, an antiterrorism court in Jaranwala acquitted 10 men accused of rioting and burning a church in 2023. The Pakistani statement further claimed, “numerous other historic mosques now face similar threats of desecration or demolition, while Indian Muslims continue to experience growing social, economic, and political marginalisation.” Meanwhile, reports from Pakistan continue to highlight cases of forced conversions, particularly involving the forced marriage of Christian and Hindu girls to Sunni Muslim men in Sindh and Punjab during 2025, underscoring the irony of Pakistan’s critique of India, the report cited. \"Pakistan calls on the international community to take cognisance of the rising Islamophobia, hate speech, and hate-motivated attacks in India,\" added the Foreign Office spokesperson. \"The United Nations and relevant international bodies must play a constructive role in safeguarding Islamic heritage and ensuring protection of the religious and cultural rights of all minorities.\" \"Pakistan urges the Government of India to uphold its responsibilities by ensuring the security of all religious communities, including Muslims, and by protecting their places of worship in accordance with international human rights obligations,\" the statement mentioned. Pakistan has a record of disregarding the rights of religious minorities and their places of worship, with reports highlighting attacks on communities and the targeting of places of worship, particularly Ahmadiyya mosques. In October, airstrikes in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province killed 23 civilians. New Delhi slammed Islamabad’s hypocrisy at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), highlighting the ongoing persecution of minorities in Pakistan. While India celebrates the historic completion of the Ram Mandir, Pakistan’s selective criticism contrasts with its own ongoing challenges in protecting religious minorities.

    "text": "My Account Follow us on: Powered By See the top gainers, losers, invest and get updated what's happening in the crypto market Invest Now Powered By Discover the secret world of unlisted shares — analyse India's top pre-IPO companies and invest before they hit the markets Invest Now Benchmark indicesSensexand Nifty are on course to snap their three-day losses on November 26 by rising 0.9% apiece amid broad-based buying. At 10:51 am, the Sensex was up 760.75 points or 0.9% at 85,347.76, and the Nifty was up 236.60 points or 0.91% at 26,121.40. About 2,530 shares advanced, 939 shares declined, and 156 shares were unchanged. Here are key factors behind market rise: Fed rate cut optimism Amid rising expectations of an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut, Indian benchmarks were trading higher, tracking Asian peers, with information technology and metal shares leading the gains. All 16 major sectors advanced in early trade. The broader small-caps and mid-caps rose about 1% each. Other Asian markets rose 1%, tracking an uptick in Wall Street equities after data showed US retail sales rose less than expected and consumer confidence weakened, bolstering expectations of a Fed rate cut in December. Comments from two Fed policymakers favouring a December rate cut also aided sentiment. Lower interest rates in the US make emerging markets such as India more attractive for foreign investors. IT companies, which earn a major share of their revenue from the US, rose 0.8%. Metals gained 1.7% as U.S. rate cut hopes aided demand outlook. \"Global sentiment remains constructive, supported by expectations of a December U.S. rate cut, keeping the overall tone optimistic,\" said Hitesh Tailor, research analyst at Choice Broking. Rate cut expectations also rose because a Bloomberg report said Kevin Hassett, who is currently the White House National Economic Council Director, was being considered as the next Fed chairperson. Domestic rate-sensitive sectors such as financials, banks, PSU lenders, auto, consumer and realty gained between 0.5% and 1%, on expectations of a domestic rate cut next week after the central bank governor signalled scope for further rate reduction. FII buying FII buying was witnessed on November 25, which could have contributed to the bullish sentiment. \" Yesterday’s 74 point fall in Nifty despite the positive institutional buy figure of Rs 4,697 crore is a case of expiry-related volatility. The relevant question is: what should investors do during such indecisive movements in the market. The best strategy for retail investors is to refrain from trading and slowly accumulate fairy-valued high quality growth stocks which will be available at attractive valuations due to heightened volatility. Such stocks will bounce back soon. Investors’ psychological behaviour is more important in such contexts. \"Fundamentals indicate that the market is moving to a new high: It’s only a question of time. Investors’ response should be based on this understanding,\" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited. \"On the flows front, FIIs were net buyers to the tune of approximately Rs 785 crore, while DIIs were strong net buyers with inflows of around Rs 3,912 crore, underscoring the continued dominance of domestic participation even as foreign inflows begin to improve. \"Given this backdrop, a selective buy-on-dips strategy remains appropriate. Traders should keep tight trailing stop-losses and consider partial profit-booking on rallies. Fresh long positions can be considered once the Nifty convincingly crosses 26,100–26,130, while keeping a close watch on global cues and key technical levels,\" said Tailor. Buying in heavyweights The three heaviest weighted stocks in the benchmarks, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank andReliance Industries, which together constitute nearly 30% weightage on Nifty 50, gained about 1% each. India VIX stood at 12.07 on 25th November, indicating a low-volatility environment. This reflects stable market sentiment, with traders not expecting major near-term swings. Meanwhile, Bank Nifty hit fresh record high of 59,515 on November 26 with Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank leading the gains. Brent Crude below $63 Falling crude oil prices also aided the bullish market sentiment as Ukraine hinted that an intense diplomatic push by the U.S. administration to end Russia's war against it could be yielding fruit. An end to the war in Ukraine could pave the way for the unwinding of Western sanctions against Moscow's energy trade, potentially adding more supply at a time when commodity prices have been battered by expectations of a glut next year. Brent crude futures fell 89 cents, or 1.4%, to $62.48 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures also fell 89 cents, or 1.5%, to $57.95 a barrel. Both benchmarks hit their lowest levels since October 22 during intraday trading. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy could visit the U.S. in the next few days to finalise a deal with U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpto end the war, Kyiv's national security chief Rustem Umerov said. Indian oil marketing companies' (OMC) stocksclimbed on Wednesday as crude oil prices remained under pressure, extending their decline to one-month lows. The rebound in Indian Oil Corp, HPCL and BPCL stocks comes a day after the three PSU oil marketers fell on Tuesday following a sharp downgrade from Investec. The brokerage warned that weakening diesel marketing margins posed a material earnings risk despite stronger refining margins. Technical View \"Derivatives data pointed to strong call writing at the 26,000 strike, while maximum put open interest at 25,800 indicated firm demand at lower levels. While the broader sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, a sustained close above the 26,000 mark will be essential to revive bullish momentum and unlock further upside potential in the coming sessions\" said Amruta Shinde, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Choice Equity Broking Private Limited.
